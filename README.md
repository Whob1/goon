# goon

This repository is a minimal Go agent project, ready for development!

## Quick Start

### 2. Initialize and Build
```sh
# Download dependencies (none yet, but required for proper module setup)
go mod tidy

# Build the project
 go build -o goon main.go

# Run the agent
./goon
```

### 3. Project Structure
